ðŸ”¥ Flame Detection using YOLOv8

This project implements a real-time fire and flame detection system using YOLOv8 (Ultralytics). The model detects flames in images, videos, or live camera streams, and saves results with bounding boxes and detection details.

Features:
âœ” Detect flames in images, videos, or webcam streams
âœ” Saves output images/videos with bounding boxes
âœ” Exports detection results (.txt) with class, confidence, and coordinates
âœ” Option to process large videos efficiently using stream=True
